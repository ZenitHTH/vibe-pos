### Rule of NextJS + Tailwind CSS Coding

# 1.Don't always create new components

try to use global compoenets that project have it, if that haven't in global. write new one and insert in global component.

# 2.Don't write hardcode css

use only global.css keep color theme in same tone

# 3.Don't write very lone code in same file

don't write everything in one file, split to new component / hook / lib / context / etc for a perpose file
